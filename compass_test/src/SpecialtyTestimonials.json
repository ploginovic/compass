        "name": "Anesthesiology",
        "testimonial": "Ether. Chloroform. Nitrous oxide. Because they are widely popularized in popular culture, you are probably well aware of the first universally accepted general anesthetics. The anesthesiologist’s domain, however, extends far beyond these drugs. It is unfortunate that many medical schools do not require a rotation in anesthesiology, sedation analgesia, and pain management. Most students do not come to medical school intending to become anesthesiologists. Instead, they share the common misperception that anesthesiologists are scientific technicians who just put patients to sleep. Nothing could be farther from the truth. They are doctors whose lives are dedicated toward a noble goal: the relief of pain. They thrive on the fast pace of acute medical care. They are the unsung heroes of the operating room."

            "name": "Dermatology",
            "testimonial": "As the largest of all organ systems, the integumentary system—comprised of skin and associated structures—can present with any number of diseases and conditions. Dermatology, therefore, is a much broader field than most people realize, ranging from the management of benign skin disorders and cosmetics to the treatment of skin cancers using intricate surgical procedures. It is a specialty that is intricately tied with the principles of internal medicine, because many diseases of the skin are manifestations of inner, systemic problems. One of the most competitive specialties to match into, dermatology provides a rewarding and intellectually satisfying medical career. You will become an expert diagnostician of complex skin problems, integrate both medical and surgical treatment options, and also provide patients with emotional and psychological support."

        "name": "Emergency Medicine",
        "testimonial": "Nearly all medical students have watched emergency room physicians save lives and cure disease on E.R., the popular television series. They witness the high drama, witty banter, cool procedures, diagnostic coups, and romance. Life (and medicine), though, is usually nothing like the TV show. Does the specialty of emergency medicine really live up to its glamorous image? Fast-paced and unpredictable, emergency medicine is one of the newest specialties in medicine. It has grown to meet the challenge of 100 million emergency room visits per year. As you know, the ER is always open and easily accessible. Emergency physicians must be prepared for any type of medical problem that arrives at the door, whether by foot, car, ambulance, or helicopter. It is never boring. They take care of a wide cross-section of Americans of all ages and races, rich and poor, insured and uninsured. These specialists like to work fast and think on their feet while serving on the front lines of medicine."

      {
        "name": "General Practice",
        "testimonial": "The specialty of family practice encompasses such a wide range of medicine that it is difficult to truly define a single scope of practice. Some physicians devote most of their time to high-risk obstetrics and operative deliveries, and others manage a harried clinic full of adults, children, and elderly in varying states of wellness and sickness. In the tradition of this community-based specialty, family physicians are well integrated into their communities and actively address issues in their patients’ lives other than medical problems. This is why family medicine doctors serve as advocates—for patients, health care systems, and social change. No matter the role, these physicians emphasize health maintenance, disease prevention, and medical treatment, always aware of the psychosocial dimensions of their patients’ lives."

      {
        "name": "General Surgery",
        "testimonial": "Surgeons save lives and heal the sick with their own hands. Surgery is the ultimate curative therapy for many patients and is an essential part of modern medicine. It is a career of constant excitement, high energy, quick decisions, and intellectual stimulation. No day is the same as the one before, and you learn to expect the unexpected. It is extremely gratifying to see the immediate results of your actions: the changes you make in your patients’ anatomy and in the quality of their lives. Whether you are interested in performing open-heart surgery or repairing perforated peptic ulcers, you must first go through rigorous training in general surgery—the foundation and entry point for all areas of this branch of medicine. Some continue to practice as general surgeons; others move on to advanced training and become surgical subspecialists like cardiothoracic, pediatric, or vascular surgeons."
      },
      {
        "name": "Internal Medicine",
        "testimonial": "If you are unsure what the discipline of internal medicine really includes, you are not alone! Many medical students, patients, public policy makers, and even physicians in other fields of medicine might find it difficult to define. Terms such as internist and internal medicine often elude patients. In fact, nearly half of all patients confuse these physicians with family practice doctors, general practitioners, or even interns (first-year residents). The diverse patient population and spectrum of diseases treated by internists have created much confusion among health care consumers. Internists take care of the general medical problems of adults. In a single day, they can act as a diagnostician, an educator, a director, an advocate, a motivator, a healer, and a comforter. In the clinic, they treat their patients’ aches, pains, and sniffles. They also come to their bedsides in the hospital and manage their inpatient care. Some internists spend their time providing acute and chronic primary care; others become subspecialists in cardiology, gastroenterology, endocrinology, and more. Whether focusing on one organ system or taking care of the whole patient, internists approach everything with great intellectual curiosity. Sick patients with complex medical problems turn to internists for high quality care."

        "name": "Neurology",
        "testimonial": "Neurology is the practice of medicine that concentrates on the human brain and nervous system. From higher cognitive disorders (such as Alzheimer dementia) to diseases of nerve and muscle (neuropathies and myopathies), neurologists serve as nervous system specialists at every level. With compassion and dedication, neurologists take care of patients presenting with a wide variety of complaints: headaches, numbness, weakness, tremors, seizures, speech difficulty, and changes in consciousness. Although they deal with some of the most distressing and debilitating diseases in medicine, neurologists tend to have an upbeat, calm, and casual attitude. They typically combine a sophisticated level of intellectual curiosity with down-to-earth friendliness and optimism. Many medical students, after completing their rotation in neurology, are familiar with the stereotype of neurologists as excellent diagnosticians who cannot treat the underlying neurologic disorders. This observation may have been somewhat true 30 years ago. Today, therapeutics are equally as exciting as diagnostics. In the past several decades, new developments in neuropharmacology and non-invasive technology have revolutionized the modern practice of neurology. As our understanding of neurologic disease continues to expand, neurology stands as one of the most stimulating fields in medicine."

      {
        "name": "Neurosurgery",
        "testimonial": "When something goes wrong with the nervous system, neurosurgeons are the specialists who intervene surgically to fix the problem. Contrary to popular belief, neurosurgery is not rocket science. It is, however, brain surgery—at least in part. A surprisingly broad and multifaceted surgical specialty, neurosurgery also encompasses components of surgical oncology, vascular surgery, and orthopedics. Neurosurgeons deal with disease processes that are unique to the central nervous system: Parkinson disease, epilepsy, developmental disorders, and even psychiatric disorders. The surgical approach to this gamut of pathologies, as you might imagine, is also remarkably diverse. In a given week, a neurosurgeon may delicately dissect out a brain tumor under the operating microscope, perform a spinal fusion with pedicle screw fixation, and use minimally invasive stereotactic techniques for surgery on a patient with Parkinson disease."

        "name": "Obstetrics and Gynecology",
        "testimonial": "Every woman needs a good obstetrician-gynecologist. These multidisciplinary specialists practice preventive medicine, deliver new lives into the world, and perform surgery. Most of their patients are healthy young women who come for prenatal care or annual physical examinations. More than just experts on the pelvic region and reproductive tract, OB/GYN physicians must handle problems that require highly technical medical and surgical skills, and, at the other end of the spectrum, be sensitive observers who can give psychological support. They are compassionate, highly focused listeners and clinicians who render the highest quality medical and surgical care. Whether in the clinic, operating room, or labor and delivery ward, their methods of diagnosis and treatment options are rapidly expanding."

        "name": "Ophthalmology",
        "testimonial": "Imagine the smallest, darkest, hottest room in which you have ever been. The room is so small that you cannot stand up straight and it is so dark that you cannot see your hand in front of your face. The floor has rotted and, with each step, you hope that your weight is not the final insult under which it will give way. You estimate there are hundreds of mosquitoes by the noises near your ear and the bites on your skin. In a way, you are glad for the darkness because it hides depressing details of the scene surrounding you. You turn on your flashlight to reveal a gaunt elderly woman in soiled clothes, lying on a homemade mattress with her knees pressed up to her chest. Her feet are dark, necrotic, and ravaged with ulcerations. Her legs will not fully extend within this confined room. Her blood sugar is markedly elevated and her eyes appear white due to cataracts. A young boy who brings her food explains that she developed “the sugar” 20 years ago and has not left her tiny home since she became blind. A fragile woman, she holds your arms tightly while being brought to the hospital. Without sight, only human touch could assure her that she was not alone. My encounter with this woman, on a service trip to Belize during medical school, gave me an unforgettable glimpse of the profound impact the loss of vision can have on human existence."

        "name": "Orthopedic Surgery",
        "testimonial": "At some point in their lives, many people require the care of an orthopedic surgeon: little children who fall down on elementary school playgrounds, high school basketball players who twist their knees, and elderly men and women with chronic leg pain. Each patient seeks the expertise of a specialist in orthopedic surgery—highly trained physicians who treat the diseases and injuries of the entire musculoskeletal system, from the neck down to the toes. Although considered specialists, orthopedic surgeons actually have a rather broad knowledge base and take care of a wide spectrum of disease. Although orthopedic surgery implies that most problems seen within this specialty are treated surgically, this notion is far from the truth. In fact, despite the long years of surgical training, most patient care is nonoperative. Cutting and curing is indeed an important part of orthopedic surgery, but medical students should keep in mind that it is not the sole focus of this wonderful specialty."

      {
        "name": "Otolaryngology",
        "testimonial": "Many medical students make the mistake of referring to otolaryngologists as ENT (ear, nose, and throat) doctors. Technically, the official name of this specialty—according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology—is Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery. This description conveys the true scope of practice of these specialists: the medical and surgical management of any disorder in the entire head and neck region and its related structures (excluding, of course, the eyes and the brain—reserved for ophthalmologists, neurologists, and neurosurgeons). These specialists are the ones to whom patients turn with particularly complex disorders of the ears, sinuses, oral cavity, larynx, throat, and other parts of the head and neck. The many structures in this region can all become diseased, creating a diverse group of surgical and medical problems. The patient population of infants, children, and adults is also diverse. Understanding the intricate anatomy of the head and neck is quite a challenge in itself. This is part of what makes otolaryngology such a wonderful specialty: it incorporates medical care with cutting-edge surgical technology."

      {
        "name": "Pathology",
        "testimonial": "Why would anyone want to become a pathologist? After all, their patients are already dead. For most people, pathology conjures up images of morgues, dead bodies, and jars of formaldehyde. Although forensics and autopsy examinations are important elements of pathology, this specialty encompasses a much wider array of investigative arenas. Pathologists use the oldest diagnostic techniques (gross examination) while at the same time developing the newest (real-time polymerase chain reaction). With these methods, they are at the forefront of medical discovery. Pathology is exciting, multidimensional, and fundamental to medicine. Its limited patient interaction makes pathology an often-misunderstood field. Until recently, popular culture has not taken to glamorizing this medical specialty, which has led to pathology’s rather low profile within society. No authors ever write novels about the heroic pathologist who spends hours poring over slides and discovers three cancer cells lurking under a lymph node capsule. Movies and television shows never portray the lives saved by a pathologist who detected mesothelioma in a hernia sac or a deadly sarcoma in a seemingly routine gangrenous toe specimen. This is, after all, what pathology is all about."

        "name": "Pediatrics",
        "testimonial": "In nineteenth century England, before the advent of pasteurized milk, immunizations, intravenous hydration, or antibiotics, half of all children died before reaching their fifth birthday. George Armstrong, a prominent physician of this time, described in his Account of the Diseases Most Incident in Children (1808) how the specialty of pediatrics was quite literally still in its infancy, with many doctors simply afraid to take care of infants and children: I have heard an eminent physician say, that he never wished to be called in to a young child; because he was really at a loss to know what to order for it. Nay, I am told, that there is nothing to be done for children when they are ill. Clearly, the medical care of children has come a long way. In addition to the primary care and preventive medicine of general pediatrics, pediatricians can choose to focus on acute problems requiring immediate treatment (critical care, neonatology, emergency medicine) or a wide range of technical procedures (cardiology, pulmonology, gastroenterology). With such a wide variety of career options, considering a career in pediatrics starts with one not-so-simple question: Do you like kids?"

      {
        "name": "Occupational Medicine",
        "testimonial": "Surprisingly, many students have completed several years of medical school before they finally learn about 'PM&R' and what this specialty entails–the restoration of function using physical modalities. Physical medicine and rehabilitation is based on the philosophy that addressing physical and cognitive impairments due to injury and disease will decrease disability. Physicians who specialize in PM&R are known as physiatrists. Physical medicine and rehabilitation is a little-known specialty that even remains misunderstood by some in the medical community. If you tell someone you are interested in physiatry, you will undoubtedly get many questions: Did you say psychiatry? You are going to become a physical therapist? Are there really residency programs in physical medicine and rehabilitation? How long has this specialty been around? Although ignorance of this burgeoning field is still common, this should change in the near future as demand for the specialty continues to grow and as patients continue to make amazing achievements while under the care of a physiatrist."

      {
        "name": "Plastic Surgery",
        "testimonial": "Although many plastic surgeons perform cosmetic surgery on high-profile patients, this specialty involves much more than Hollywood movie stars and breast implants. The word plastic is derived from the Greek plastikos, meaning 'to shape, change, or mould.' As such, the goals of plastic surgery are threefold: (1) to alter surgically the form and function of anatomy—either normal or pathologic; (2) to improve the quality of life; and (3) to preserve life itself. No other surgical specialist draws on a wider base of anatomic knowledge or operates in more regions of the body than does a plastic surgeon. It has been said that plastic surgeons operate on 'the skin and its contents,' alluding to the fact that on any given day plastic surgeons might find themselves operating on the face, on the hand, inside the cranium, or inside the abdominal or thoracic cavities. The field has developed from the efforts and contributions of people from many different backgrounds, including general surgery, orthopedics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and otolaryngology. Plastic surgery receives all the media attention yet remains poorly understood by the general public—and often by physicians as well. In some ways, it may seem to be a paradoxical specialty. Plastic surgery encompasses all of aesthetic surgery, yet it also deals with clinical entities that are often considered grotesque, including chronic wounds, limb replantation, and head and neck reconstruction. It is considered a surgical subspecialty, yet the fund of knowledge needed for even a basic understanding of the discipline requires a five- to eight-volume text. And although it is a relative newcomer as an organized specialty, some of the first recorded operations were performed by plastic surgeons."

        "name": "Psychiatry",
        "testimonial": "As physicians who treat the mentally ill, psychiatrists have some of the most rewarding long-term relationships with their patients. This is an interdisciplinary specialty, well-suited for doctors who wish to use the broadest of all skills—psychosocial, scientific, and clinical. Historically, psychotherapy has always formed the core of psychiatry. But with remarkable advances in neuroscience and drug therapy, this field of medicine has shifted to a more biological-based approach. Now, psychiatrists draw on the latest research in brain imaging, genetics, and psychopharmacology to treat many debilitating disorders. Most medical students begin their psychiatry clerkship with a preconceived notion of this specialty. You probably imagine that all psychiatrists tell their patients to lie down on their leather couches and talk about their childhood. Or, you may think that these physicians are simply drug dispensers. In reality, the practice of contemporary psychiatry falls somewhere between these two extremes."

      {
        "name": "Nuclear Medicine",
        "testimonial": "Historically, radiation oncology has been one of the best kept secrets in medicine. Yet the specialty has of late become one of the most competitive fields for entering applicants. Radiation oncology is an intellectual discipline with physician–patient relationships at its heart. Its strength and appeal lies in the multidimensional approach to treating cancer patients. Paradoxically, as popular as the field has become among medical students, radiation oncology remains poorly understood, even by other physicians. Radiation oncologists, who are embedded within the interdisciplinary practice of cancer treatment, play a role as both primary oncologist to cancer patients and as consultants to other physicians. It is a field that weds the physician’s breadth of knowledge to the meticulous application of technical expertise. Every cancer patient, after all, offers an individual challenge."
      },
      {
        "name": "Radiology",
        "testimonial": "With the discovery of the x-ray, the specialty of radiology was born. It has rapidly grown into an advanced, highly cerebral discipline encompassing a variety of high-tech imaging modalities. If you want to serve at the forefront of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, and be the physician to whom clinicians turn for advice, then take a closer look at radiology. Radiology is the branch of medicine in which radiologic images are interpreted for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. Technological advances in medical imaging—and its growing role in the diagnosis and management of disease—have transformed radiology into one of the premier fields of modern medicine. Many of the greatest achievements in health care have come from radiologists. Now new imaging modalities are being used to pioneer faster, better, and safer procedures. These exciting technological advances, along with the income potential and relatively humane lifestyle, make it no surprise that radiology has become an increasingly popular and selective specialty."

        "name": "Urology",
        "testimonial": "If you want to operate on patients, urology is one of the best surgical specialties around. Other than hearing jokes about the Viagra phenomenon, most medical students have had little experience with urology. It is a highly focused area of medicine that treats diseases of a more sensitive nature—the urinary and male genital systems—and has rather good treatment outcomes. It is a specialty where you can have long-term relationships with patients (yet not be their primary care physician), where you can perform surgery and procedures (yet still get a decent night’s sleep), and where you can truly help improve patients’ quality of life."
